# FP2 Root Update
Utility to update simply your FairPhone 2 while keeping/installing root on it.

Written in C# with .Net Core so this app can theoricaly work on Linux and Mac but only tested with Windows!

This software is Beta and may have some bugs and defaults! Please feel free to open issues/pull requests to improve it!

It uses Thomas [Thomas Pfister's FP2 root boot.img server](https://fp2.retsifp.de/)
